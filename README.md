# Ridex X - A Ride Sharing App

**Ridex X**  is a real-time ride-sharing app that helps connect riders and drivers smoothly and quickly. I built this full-stack project using the MERN stack and spent about 1.5 months bringing it to life. With Socket.io integrated, users and drivers can communicate instantly, making the whole experience faster and more interactive
